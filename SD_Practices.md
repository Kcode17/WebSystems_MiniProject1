# How software development companies benefit from using Git, Docker, automated testing, and continuous integration?

## Let's explore about these terms

### GIT ![GIT_Logo](/images/Git_logo.png)
Git is the most popular and widely used version control system today. Originally developed as an open source project in 2005 by the creator of the Linux operating system, it is a matured and actively maintained environment. A huge number of developers rely upon Git version controlling to develop several types of commercial and non-commercial projects. Git-based developers are well thought of and considered as valuable resources.

### Docker ![Docker_Logo](./images/Docker_logo.png)
Docker is an open-source technology used mostly for developing, shipping, and running applications. With it, you can isolate applications from their underlying infrastructure so that software delivery is faster than ever. Docker’s main benefit is to package applications in “containers,” so they’re portable for any system running the Linux operating system (OS) or Windows OS. Though container technology has been around for a while, the hype around Docker’s approach to containers has moved this approach to the mainstream as one of the most popular forms of container technology.

### Automated Testing
There are two kinds of testing in the world of software—manual and automated. Some types of manual testing, such as discovery testing and usability testing, are invaluable. You can do other kinds of testing—like regression testing and functional testing—manually.

Test automation is the practice of running tests automatically, managing test data, and utilizing results to improve software quality.

Selenium, Appium, Cucumber are few automation testing tools used in the industry.
