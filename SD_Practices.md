# How software development companies benefit from using Git, Docker, Automated Testing, and Continuous Integration?

## Let's explore about these terms

### GIT ![GIT_Logo](/Images/Git_logo.png)
Git is the most popular and widely used version control system today. Originally developed as an open source project in 2005 by the creator of the Linux operating system, it is a matured and actively maintained environment. A huge number of developers rely upon Git version controlling to develop several types of commercial and non-commercial projects. Git-based developers are well thought of and considered as valuable resources.

### Docker ![Docker_Logo](/Images/Docker_logo.png)
Docker is an open-source technology used mostly for developing, shipping, and running applications. With it, you can isolate applications from their underlying infrastructure so that software delivery is faster than ever. Docker’s main benefit is to package applications in “containers,” so they’re portable for any system running the Linux operating system (OS) or Windows OS. Though container technology has been around for a while, the hype around Docker’s approach to containers has moved this approach to the mainstream as one of the most popular forms of container technology.

### Automated Testing
There are two kinds of testing in the world of software—manual and automated. Some types of manual testing, such as discovery testing and usability testing, are invaluable. You can do other kinds of testing—like regression testing and functional testing—manually.

Test automation is the practice of running tests automatically, managing test data, and utilizing results to improve software quality.

Selenium, Appium, Cucumber are few automation testing tools used in the industry. 

### Continuous Integration
Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. It’s a primary DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository where builds and tests then run. Automated tools are used to assert the new code’s correctness before integration.
A source code version control system is the crux of the CI process. The version control system is also supplemented with other checks like automated code quality tests, syntax style review tools, and more.
CI is generally used alongside an agile software development workflow. An organization will compile list of tasks that comprise a product roadmap. These tasks are then distributed amongst software engineering team members for delivery. Using CI enables these software development tasks to be developed independently and in parallel amongst the assigned developers. Once one of these tasks is complete, a developer will introduce that new work to the CI system to be integrated with the rest of the project.

## How these technologies improve software development

- #### Efficient and Collaborative Development
Using Version control systems like git, helps developers to work collaboratively. It’s features like security and back up mechanisms help them to work efficiently with each other, thereby increasing the efficiency of the team.

- #### Deployment made easy
Docker helps in fast and efficient deployment of applications using containers which use the resources efficiently for higher throughput.

- #### Automation == Fast 
Repetitive tests can be automated to run automatically without human intervention there by reducing time spent on executing them manually. All this time can be used in exploratory testing and making sure the software works as expected.

- #### Continuous Integration is the key
Continuous integration uses all the above listed concepts to create an efficient pipeline to help developers. When a developer commits a code fix, CI makes sure the fix is integrated with the rest of the project, deployed on a environment and run tests to check if everything works as expected. Most of this process is automated or requires very less human intervention. Hence increasing throughput of a software development team and also helping the companies to be competitive in nature.
