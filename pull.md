## Git Pull

#### The git pull command can retrieve and copy content from a remote repository and update the local repository to match that content. Merging remote changes into your local repository can be used in Git collaborations. The git pull command is a combination of two other commands, git fetch followed by git merge. Firstly git pull will execute a git fetch scoped to the local branch that HEAD is pointed at. After downloading the information, git pull will merge branches. A new commit will be-created, and HEAD will point to the new commit.
